				<h3>STATEMENT OF FAITH:</h3>
				<p>For persons who are saved, have been baptized by immersion after salvation, and are members in good standing of another Baptist church that will provide a letter of recommendation to Fort Mitchell Baptist Church. For persons who are saved and have been baptized by immersion after salvation but have been members of a church of another denomination, the best way to join is by notifying one of our Pastors or Deacons that youâ€™re interested in becoming  an active member. We will answer your  questions, help you understand next steps and schedule a time when you can be presented to the church family for membership.</p>

				<h2>Our Deacons!</h2>
				<p>The Deacon Body meets monthly on the third Tuesday at 6:00 p.m., in the Conference Room of Fort Mitchell Baptist Church.  Every family who attends FMBC is assigned a family deacon, who communicates with the families on a regular basis.  If there is a crisis in the family, the deacon is on call to assist.   During the monthly meetings the deacons spend time in leadership training to learn how to be a better disciple for Christ. Deacon terms are for three years, and the selection of Deacons occurs on an annual basis as Deacons rotate off.</p>
